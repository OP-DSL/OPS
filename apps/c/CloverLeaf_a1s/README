A hydrodynamics mini-app to solve the compressible Euler equations in 2D,
using an explicit, second-order method. See http://uk-mac.github.io/CloverLeaf/
for the original version and more details.

This version utilizes the OPS library and pre-processor. With OPS a single
application code is transformed to enable it to be run with a number of
parallelisations: OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC and MPI and their
combinations with MPI.
