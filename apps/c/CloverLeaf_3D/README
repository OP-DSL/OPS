A hydrodynamics mini-app to solve the compressible Euler equations in 3D,
using an explicit, second-order method. See http://uk-mac.github.io/CloverLeaf3D/
for the original version and more details.

This version utilizes the OPS library and pre-processor. With OPS a single
application code is transformed to enable it to be run with a number of
parallelisations: OpenMP, CUDA, OpenCL, OpenACC and MPI and their
combinations with MPI.


Directory Structure
===================

|
`- ./ : Developer version that uses only a header file to get the application
|       running as a sequential application and with unoptimized MPI. Used for 
|       application debugging before using the code generation tools of OPS.
|
`- MPI : MPI and sequential version, code generated through the OPS translator. 
|        This include platform specific optimisations such as verctorization
|
`- MPI_OpenMP : MPI+OpenMP parallelization, code generated through the OPS translator.
|
`- CUDA : CUDA parallelization (including MPI+CUDA), code generated through the OPS translator.
|
`- OpenCL : OpenCL parallelization (including MPI+OpenCL), code generated through the OPS translator.
|
`- OpenACC : OpenACC parallelization (including MPI+OpenACC), code generated through the OPS translator.

Building Cloverleaf
===================

1. set the following environmental variables : e.g. for compiling with Intel compilers

   export OPS_COMPILER=intel
   export OPS_INSTALL_PATH=~/OPS/ops
   export CUDA_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5
   export MPI_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/openmpi-intel/
   export OPENCL_INSTALL_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-6.0
   export HDF5_INSTALL_PATH=/opt/hdf5-intel/

2. Build the OPS backend libraries:

   cd ~/OPS/ops/
   make

   For systems that does not have CUDA installed comment out the building of the GPU backend library.
   i.e. change the following line

   all: clean core seq openmp mpi cuda

   to

   all: clean core seq openmp mpi #cuda


3. Build the Cloverleaf applications. The following will build the developer version, MPI, MPI+OpenMP, 
   CUDA, MPI+CUDA, OpenCL, OpenCL+MPI, OpenACC and OpenACC+MPI (if your compiler supports OpenACC)

   cd ~/OPS/apps/Cloverleaf_3D/
   make
