/** @brief Print field summary
 *  @author Wayne Gaudin, converted to OPS by Gihan Mudalige
 *  @details The user specified field summary kernel is invoked here. A summation
 *  across all mesh chunks is then performed and the information outputed.
 *  If the run is a test problem, the final result is compared with the expected
 *  result and the difference output.
 *  Note the reference solution is the value returned from an Intel compiler with
 *  ieee options set on a single core crun.
