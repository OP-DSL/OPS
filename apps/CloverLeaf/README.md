A hydrodynamics mini-app to solve the compressible Euler equations in 2D, using an explicit, second-order method. See http://warwick-pcav.github.io/CloverLeaf/ for the original version and more details.

This version utilizes the OPS library and preprocessor. With OPS a single application code is transformed
to enable it to be run with a number of parallelisations: OpenMP, CUDA and MPI
