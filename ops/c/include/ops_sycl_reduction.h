  * @brief Core header file for the ops sycl reductions - adapted from OP2
  * @author Gabor Daniel Balogh
  * @details This file provides an optimised implementation for reduction of
  * OPS global variables. It is separated from the op_sycl_rt_support.h file
  * because the reduction code is based on C++ templates, while the other file
  * only includes C routines.

/**
 * @brief Performs reduction on a single value.
 *
 * @tparam reduction The reduction type, one of OPS_INC, OPS_MIN and OPS_MAX.
 * @tparam primitive type of the reduction, deduced from dat_l
 *
 * @param dat_g An accessor over the output array. Typically over instance->OPS_reduct_d.
 * @param offset Used only if linear_id == 0. Gives the index of the output in dar_g.
 * @param dat_l The local result of the reduction computed by the user kernel.
 * @param temp  Local memory used to store temporary values.
 * @param item_id The corresponding sycl item.
